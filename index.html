                <p>During my first semester at georgian college i built a text based RPG using C# and the .NET
                    framework. this game had 3 encounters and gave the player access to new moves the further they
                    progressed in the game however these moves only had a few uses available </p>

                <img src="/FinalProjectImages/Python-logo2.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>Using python i built a program that could search through an excel sheet and find upcoming birthdays
                    using regular expression and then the program would automatically put these upcoming birthdays into
                    a word document in a report format </p>

                <img src="/FinalProjectImages/arduino-logo.png" alt="">
                <p>using C++ and arduino i built an arduino circuit that worked as a memory light game which had four
                    lights and would show a pattern and the player would have to remember the pattern and re input it
                    using 4 buttons each being linked up to one of the lights</p>

                <img src="/FinalProjectImages/phpmvc.jpeg" alt="">
                <p>I am currently working on a project in PHP using the MVC architecture to build out an application
                    that will resemble a car/rental parent child relationship this application will allow you to pick
                    the car you would like to rent and choose a pickup date and a dropoff date. this application uses a
                    user login system so that each person has their own rentals. </p>

                <img src="/FinalProjectImages/JavaFX_Logo.png" alt="">
                <p>Using java i am currently building a javaFX program also using the MVC architechture to show a
                    collection of video games and their individual properties this application includes 100% fully
                    tested code using jUnit and allows users to add their own favourite video games to the collection.
                    it also allows the video games to be interacted with through a listener, when clicked it will show
                    the games specific properties.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>i live in Collingwood Ontario and other than coding, i love to play video games in my spare time and
                watch movies. i will be graduating from georgian college in April of 2024 </p>
            <p>when i was a kid i grew up in the small town of creemore ontario, it is a very small town in ontario. you
                may recognixe the name because of creemore springs. growing up in a small area my view of the world was
                very small and when i was around 12 i moved to brampton. this was a very big move and gave me
                perspective on what the world really has to offer. this was also when i started to learn about
                technology and programming. the school had an after school club which was focused on coding and since
                then i have really enjoyed it and took every opportunity in high school to learn more about programming.
                this has ultimately brought me to where i am now in college expanding my knowledge of technology and i
                am very eager to learn more.
